# [Self-Driving-Cars-Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars)
This repository contains the course materials (complimentary reading, quiz, and coding) for Self-Driving Cars Specialization on Coursera. The specialization includes 4 courses, namely: 
Introduction to Self-Driving Cars
State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars
Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars
Motion Planning for Self-Driving Cars

All together they give students a rich knowledge of self-driving cars from a basic car model, to environment perception to motion planning. My favorite course is Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars as I have a good knowledge of and a strong interest in neural networks and computer vision, but I struggled pretty hard at courses 2 and 4. It was a month-long journey, although it might have been a little bitter at certain points, it will be very rewarding soon. Hopefully, the material I put here can help some conquer this specialization more enjoyably.
